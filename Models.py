# This file is being refactored.
# FirebaseManager and BaseModel (now FirestoreBaseModel) have been moved to app/db/firebase_ops.py
# Specific model classes (ClientModel, FreelancerModel, etc.) are being removed
# and will be replaced by services using Pydantic schemas and FirestoreBaseModel.

# This file will likely be removed or repurposed later.
# For now, it's kept to avoid breaking imports if any exist,
# but its previous content is deprecated.

pass # Placeholder to make it a valid Python file if it becomes completely empty.
